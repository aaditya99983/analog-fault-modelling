# Analog-Fault-Modelling
Our work is about proposing fault diagnosis method for analog integrated circuits. Our approach is based on Machine Learning Model that is trained beforehand to guide us through diagnosis decisions. The  Model is a defect filter that detects failing devices due to gross defects (hard faults)  Thus, the defect filter is key in developing a unified hard fault diagnosis approach. hard faults are diagnosed using a multi-class classifier
